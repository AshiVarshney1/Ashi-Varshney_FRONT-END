Sure, here are the errors in the code with assignment-style descriptions:

1. In the `SingleListItem` component, the `onClickHandler` prop is assigned to the `onClick` event handler with a function call instead of a function reference. This can cause the `onClick` handler to be invoked immediately on rendering rather than waiting for the user to click on the list item.

2. In the `SingleListItem` component, the `isSelected` prop is assigned with the `selectedIndex` state value which is an index, instead of comparing it with the current index of the list item. This can cause the list items to have the same background color if one of them is selected.

3. In the `WrappedListComponent` component, the `selectedIndex` state is initialized without a default value, which can cause issues if the `items` prop is null or undefined when the component is first rendered.

4. In the `WrappedListComponent` component, the `propTypes` definition of the `items` prop is incorrect. The `array` method of `PropTypes` is not correctly invoked, and the `shapeOf` method is not a valid method of `PropTypes`. This can cause the `items` prop to be passed incorrectly, leading to runtime errors.

5. In the `WrappedListComponent` component, the `key` prop is not assigned to each list item in the `items.map()` function. This can cause performance issues when the list is updated, as React will have to re-render all the list items even if only one item is added or removed.
